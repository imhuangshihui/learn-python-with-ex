Exercise 1: Download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt
Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as
keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you
can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the
dictionary.

    for line in file:
        line = line.strip()

        for word in word_list:
            word = word.lower().strip().strip(string.punctuation)
            if word not in word_dict:
                word_dict[word]
